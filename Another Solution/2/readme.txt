There are three codes Case_A.cpp, Case_B.cpp and Case_C.cpp corresponding to each case A,B and C.
In each case there are two inputs lambda and mu.
in case A effective lambda will be lambda/3 for each queue.
In case B and C effective lambda will be lambda.
compile codes as 
g++ Case_A.cpp 
g++ Case_B.cpp
g++ Case_C.cpp.
run codes as ./a.out 

Bug: case 3 is not working as expected as it should be.
